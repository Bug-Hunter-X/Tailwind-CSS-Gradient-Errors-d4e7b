```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```

This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  A common issue is forgetting to specify the `to` value of the gradient causing unexpected rendering or no gradient at all.  Another potential error is using an incorrect color scale, for example, mixing color palettes inappropriately, resulting in jarring gradients.
